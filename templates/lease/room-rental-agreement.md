## 1) Parties, Premises, Term

### 1.1 Fixed Term
This Agreement is for a fixed term ending on the End Date.

### 1.2 Early Termination by Tenant
Tenant may terminate early with at least 30 days' written notice and remains responsible for rent until a replacement tenant begins paying rent or through the End Date, whichever occurs first. Lessor may charge an early termination fee equal to one month's rent. Personal reasons (e.g., financial hardship, job relocation, housemate disputes) do not relieve Tenant of obligations unless Lessor agrees in writing.

### 1.3 Lessor's Right to Terminate
Lessor may terminate for material breach (see §10) with 30 days' written notice (or shorter if permitted by law for certain breaches).

---

## 2) Payments, Deposits, Utilities, HOA

### 2.1 Rent, Due Date, Grace, Late Fees
- **Monthly rent:** {{MONTHLY_RENT}}, due on or before the 1st of each month.
- **Grace period:** through 11:59 p.m. on the 5th (no late fee during grace).
- **Late fee:** 5% of monthly rent if not received by end of grace.
- If rent remains unpaid by the 10th, Tenant is in material breach.
- Repeated failure to pay by the 1st (even within grace) may constitute breach if it interferes with property management.

### 2.2 Accepted Payment Methods
- Cash (in person at a mutually agreed location/time; receipt provided).
- Cashier's Check (payable to Lessor).
- Prohibited unless approved in writing: personal checks; third-party apps; credit cards; bank drafts.
- Returned/Chargeback/Dishonored Payment Fee: $35 or the maximum allowed by law, per occurrence.

### 2.3 Order of Application of Payments
Unless prohibited by law, payments are applied first to past-due fees/charges, then to utilities/other amounts, then to the oldest rent due, and lastly to current rent.

### 2.4 Acceptance of Partial Rent
Acceptance of partial rent or subsidy does not waive breach or Lessor's right to proceed with summary ejectment.

### 2.5 Security Deposit
Tenant shall pay a security deposit of **{{SECURITY_DEPOSIT}}**, due upon signing this Agreement.

The Lessor shall return the security deposit within the maximum time period permitted by applicable state or local law, along with an itemized statement of deductions. If deductions cannot be fully determined within that time, Lessor may provide an interim accounting and return any remaining balance with a final accounting within the extended period permitted by law. Deductions may include unpaid rent, utilities, damages beyond normal wear and tear, cleaning costs, and common-area damage (shared among tenants unless a specific individual accepts responsibility in writing).

### 2.6 Utilities & Service Sharing
- Tenant pays an equal share of utilities (water, garbage, gas, electricity, internet), lawn/landscape maintenance, pest control, HVAC air filters, and common-area light bulbs.
- Lessor provides bill copies on request and notice of monthly amounts due; Tenant must pay within 5 days of notice.
- **Fair-Use/Excess:** If usage is excessive or wasteful (e.g., repeated open windows with HVAC on, unattended lights, misuse causing spikes), Lessor may allocate excess surcharges proportionally on notice.
- **Service Interruption:** No guarantee of uninterrupted services; Lessor is not liable for losses from outages. Tenant is responsible for safeguarding food, electronics, and personal property.
- **Obligation to Pay Regardless of Occupancy:** Tenant remains responsible for their share of utilities and service costs regardless of whether they are physically present at the Premises.

### 2.7 Responsibility for Damage & Misuse (Tenant-Caused)
Tenant bears full cost of repair/replacement arising from negligence, misuse, or failure to promptly report issues (e.g., clogged drains from hair/grease/foreign objects; misuse of appliances; damage to utilities/landscaping/preventive systems).

### 2.8 Homeowners' Association (HOA)
Tenant complies with the HOA CC&Rs, rules, and any amendments. Tenant provides requested information (vehicle details, occupant names, etc.). Tenant is fully responsible for fines/fees arising from Tenant's conduct (parking, noise, trash, lawn standards, etc.). Lessor may pay and recover from Tenant within 5 days of notice. Failure to comply is a material breach.

---

## 3) Possession & Occupancy

### 3.1 Possession Delivery
Failure of Tenant to take possession does not relieve rent obligations. If Lessor cannot deliver possession for reasons beyond control, rent accrues only upon delivery. If possession is not delivered within 14 days of Start Date, Tenant may terminate with written notice and receive refund of prepaid amounts. No additional damages.

### 3.2 Occupancy, Guests, Subleasing
No assignment, sublease, or additional occupants are permitted. Overnight guests are prohibited unless Lessor gives prior written consent. For purposes of this Agreement, "overnight" means presence on the Premises between 10:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m. Large gatherings, parties, or group events of any kind are prohibited without Lessor's written consent. Daytime guests are permitted in small groups only and must comply with all rules of the house; Tenant is responsible for guest conduct. Any violation of this section constitutes a material breach of this Agreement and may result in immediate termination of tenancy.

### 3.3 Joint & Several Liability; Notices
All Tenants are jointly and severally liable for obligations and damages. Notices to any adult occupant constitute notice to Tenant; requests from any adult occupant constitute Tenant's request. In eviction suits, the Tenant is considered the agent of the Premises for service of process to the extent permitted by law.

### 3.4 Right of Entry
- **Common Areas:** Lessor may enter shared spaces at any time for inspection, maintenance, cleaning, or management.
- **Private Rooms:** Lessor may enter for inspection, maintenance, or showings with 24 hours' notice (reasonable hours), except emergencies.
- **Emergencies:** Entry without notice is permitted.
- **Periodic Inspections:** Quarterly; Lessor gives 7 days' written notice.

### 3.5 Extended Absences & Abandonment
Tenant must notify Lessor in writing if away >15 consecutive days; Lessor may enter as reasonably necessary. Abandonment includes absence ≥15 days without notice while rent is ≥14 days past due and no evidence of occupancy beyond personal property. Lessor may regain possession per law.

### 3.6 Holdover
Holdover without written consent creates a tenancy at sufferance billed at 150% of last monthly rent, prorated daily, plus consequential damages (e.g., lost rent due to delayed new tenancy), and is grounds for immediate summary ejectment.

### 3.7 Pets / Assistance Animals
Assistance animals (service animals/ESAs) permitted as required by law with reliable documentation for ESAs consistent with fair-housing guidance. Tenant remains responsible for damage or disturbances. All other pets require Lessor's prior written consent.

---

## 4) Use of Premises (Core) & Restricted Activities

Tenant must use the Premises solely as a private residence and comply with all laws and ordinances.

**House Rules:** Detailed daily-living rules are set forth in Addendum A – House Rules, which is incorporated into and made part of this Agreement. Any violation of the House Rules is a material breach of this Agreement and grounds for termination of tenancy, subject to any notice and cure rights required by applicable law.

Tenant acknowledges receipt of the House Rules and agrees that Landlord may reasonably amend the House Rules from time to time by providing Tenant with written notice; any such amendment becomes enforceable 30 days after notice unless Tenant objects in writing and terminates the tenancy in accordance with state law.

No tampering with spaces/appliances/fixtures outside authorized areas. No using other tenants' food/supplies/furniture/equipment without permission.

### 4.2 Safety, Respect, and Truthful Communications
Tenant must not threaten, harass, or intimidate others. Tenant is solely responsible for personal safety/security; Lessor does not guarantee safety of premises/neighborhood/other persons and is not liable for criminal acts/third-party conduct. Tenant must communicate truthfully regarding property conditions and interactions; knowingly false statements causing conflict, investigation, or costs are a material breach.

**Intoxication:** Tenant shall not consume or be under the influence of alcohol, cannabis, or any impairing substance while on the Premises. Any single instance of intoxication/impairment on the Premises is a material breach.

## 5) Property Condition, Maintenance & Repairs

### 5.1 General Maintenance & Repairs
Tenant must keep the Premises clean, sanitary, and in good condition, and promptly report needed repairs. Tenant is responsible for the cost of repairs or replacements caused by Tenant's or Tenant's guests' misuse, negligence, or failure to promptly report problems.

Lessor is responsible for repairs required due to normal wear and tear not caused by Tenant or guests. Lessor determines whether to repair or replace in accordance with law.

### 5.2 Maintenance Duties & Fee Schedule (Incorporation of Addendum B)
Tenant's specific maintenance duties, cleaning requirements, and the schedule of common charges/fees are set forth in Addendum B — Maintenance & Fee Schedule, which is incorporated into this Agreement by reference.

Tenant acknowledges receipt of Addendum B and agrees to:
- Perform the listed maintenance tasks at the stated frequency,
- Take the preventive measures described, and
- Pay the listed fees if Tenant fails to perform or if damage/cleaning becomes necessary.

Lessor may update Addendum B from time to time by providing Tenant with at least 30 days' written notice; such updates become binding unless Tenant objects in writing and terminates the tenancy in accordance with applicable law.

Failure to perform these duties or pay the listed fees constitutes a material breach of this Agreement.

### 5.3 Alterations & Improvements; Casualty
Tenant may not make alterations (painting, paneling, heavy hangings > 20 lbs, etc.) without Lessor's prior written consent.

If the Premises becomes uninhabitable through no fault of Tenant, either party may terminate by written notice within 15 days. If uninhabitability results from Tenant's acts or omissions, only Lessor may terminate and Tenant remains liable for all losses (including repairs and lost rent).

### 5.4 Safety Devices (Smoke/CO)
Premises are equipped with smoke and CO detectors. Tenant must test regularly, replace batteries as needed, and report any malfunctions to Lessor.

### 5.5 Move-In & Move-Out Standards
Within seventy-two (72) hours of possession, Tenant must submit a written Move-In Condition Report with photos documenting the condition of the Premises.

At move-out, Tenant must:
- Complete and submit a written Move-Out Condition Report (with photos if requested by Lessor) at or before the final inspection;
- Return the Premises in substantially the same condition as received, ordinary wear excepted, and meet the cleaning standard in Addendum B;
- Provide itemized receipts for professional cleaning of both the bedroom and all common areas (kitchen, bathrooms, hallways, living spaces, and exterior areas used by Tenant).

If Tenant fails to provide the Move-Out Condition Report or cleaning receipts, Lessor may complete the report unilaterally, arrange professional cleaning, and deduct the full cost from Tenant's security deposit.

### 5.6 Renter's Insurance
Tenant is strongly encouraged—and may be required on written notice—to maintain renters insurance (minimum $100,000 liability coverage). Lessor's insurance does not cover Tenant's personal property.

---

## 6) Risk Allocation; Cameras; Dangerous Materials; Indemnity

### 6.1 Security Cameras (Notice & Waiver)
Entrance/common areas may be monitored by cameras. No cameras in private rooms/bathrooms. Tampering/disabling/obstructing is prohibited. Cameras are deterrence only; Lessor assumes no duty to monitor or respond and is not liable for criminal/third-party acts, even if captured on video.

### 6.2 Dangerous Materials
No dangerous/flammable/explosive materials that increase fire risk or hazard.

### 6.3 Indemnification
Tenant acknowledges Lessor's insurance does not cover Tenant's property and agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold Lessor harmless from claims, liabilities, damages, and expenses (including attorneys' fees) arising out of Tenant's occupancy, conduct of Tenant/guests, or breach. This survives termination.

---

## 7) Legal Defaults & Remedies

### 7.1 Tenant's Breach (Events)
Breach includes (without limitation): nonpayment of rent/utilities/amounts due; violations of this Agreement or laws (fire/safety/health/criminal), regardless of arrest/conviction; abandonment; false application info; arrest/conviction/deferred adjudication for offenses involving harm or controlled substances; presence of illegal drugs or paraphernalia on the Premises; and any other cause allowed by law.

### 7.2 Possession & Ejectment
Whether Lessor terminates the lease or only Tenant's right of possession, Lessor is entitled to immediate possession upon demand; refusal allows Lessor to re-enter only through summary ejectment.

### 7.3 Fees/Costs of Summary Ejectment
Tenant shall pay court filing fees, service costs, the applicable complaint-filing/court appearance/second-trial fees, and reasonable attorneys' fees actually incurred.

### 7.4 Termination Paths
- **Lease Terminated:** Tenant owes all accrued but unpaid rent, utilities, and damages (including holdover/continued occupancy damages).
- **Possession Terminated Only:** Tenant remains liable for all covenants. Lessor will use reasonable efforts to re-let; rents received are applied to re-letting costs then rent due; Tenant is liable for any deficiency. In any enforcement action, Tenant pays reasonable attorneys' fees.

### 7.5 Lessor's Default & Cure
Tenant must provide written notice of alleged default and a reasonable cure period. No defect/delay in recreational facilities (e.g., pools, clubhouses) shall constitute material breach, suspend Tenant's performance, or permit termination. No liability for consequential damages, emotional distress, inconvenience, or loss of use; Tenant's sole remedy is rent abatement as required by law.

# Addendum C — Bed Bug Disclosure & Protocol

## 1. Education & Inspection
Tenant acknowledges receipt of the Bed Bug Information Sheet provided by Lessor, which explains how to identify bed bugs, prevent introduction, and prepare for treatment.

Tenant inspected their room and common areas at move-in and found no signs of infestation unless noted on the Move-In Condition Form. If Tenant fails to submit a Move-In Condition Form within the allowed timeframe, the room and common areas shall be presumed free of infestation at the start of tenancy.

## 2. Duty to Report
Tenant must immediately provide written notice to Lessor upon observing or suspecting:
- Bites consistent with bed bug activity
- Live or dead bed bugs
- Fecal spots, shed skins, or eggs on bedding, furniture, walls, or floors

Written notice must be provided via email, text message, or written letter. Prompt reporting helps prevent spread and reduces treatment costs for everyone.

## 3. Preparation & Cooperation
Tenant agrees to fully comply with preparation instructions from the licensed pest professional, which may include:
- Laundering and drying clothing, bedding, and personal items on high heat
- Bagging or sealing clean items to prevent reinfestation
- Decluttering to allow full access to baseboards, closets, and furniture
- Moving furniture away from walls as directed
- Granting access to their room and belongings for inspection and treatment
- Vacating the premises during treatment if required

Failure to cooperate may result in additional treatment costs, rescheduling fees, or lease violation notices.

## 4. Responsibility & Cost Allocation
- **Within 30 Days of Move-In:** If bed bugs are reported and confirmed by a licensed professional within 30 days of Tenant's move-in date, Lessor will arrange and pay for professional treatment.
- **After 30 Days:** If bed bugs are reported or discovered more than 30 days after move-in, the cost of professional treatment will be divided equally among all tenants living in the home at the time treatment is scheduled, unless the pest professional specifically attributes the infestation to one tenant's belongings or actions, in which case that tenant shall pay 100% of the costs.
- The findings of the licensed pest control professional regarding source and extent of infestation shall be final and binding for cost allocation.

## 5. Whole-House Treatment Requirement
Tenant acknowledges that bed bugs migrate through walls, floors, and common areas. If an infestation is confirmed in any room, whole-house treatment will be required (heat treatment and/or chemical treatment). Partial treatments or self-help measures are prohibited and may result in additional costs or re-infestation.

## 6. No Disposal Without Approval
Tenant shall not discard, move, or place mattresses, upholstered furniture, or other items outdoors without prior written approval from Lessor or the licensed pest control company. Improper disposal may spread infestation and result in additional charges to Tenant.

## 7. Consequences of Non-Compliance
Failure to report, prepare, or cooperate with treatment may be considered a breach of the lease and may result in:
- Additional treatment costs charged to Tenant
- Deductions from security deposit
- Termination of tenancy if non-compliance interferes with remediation
